etam: metadata storing on top of eet library.

The purpose of this library is to offer an easy way
to store metadata linked with a key in an eet library
with a completly asynchronous API.

Their is still a huge amount of work to do it right.
I have been focusing myself on the backend. There is
no documentation, don't expect it at this point. I am
dropping this code at an early unusable point so that
some people can start helping me advance it. It is point
less for anyone to try and compile this code actually.

The targeted users of this library are enna and enki.
