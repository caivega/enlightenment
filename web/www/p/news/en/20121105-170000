At the EFL Dev Day during a talk by Jorge "turran" Zapata, decisions were made. These decisions resulted
in actions which ended up breaking my gmail (no joke), possibly foreshadowing the breaking of the world later on.
This is the announcement for the ALPHA release of Enlightenment DR 0.17. E17 is a desktop environment
that's been under development for a couple years, and it's finally at the point where we're happy enough with it to
do an alpha release. Conveniently, this comes mere hours before I will be giving a presentation at LinuxCon
wherein I will announce the release schedule for E17.
