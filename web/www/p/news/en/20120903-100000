<p>
Due to the previous release of E17 containing a number of unfortunate bugs and
undesirable behavior, I'm putting out a new snapshot today. This features
a number of improvements, include <b>LESS CRASHING</b> and <b>IMPROVEMENTS TO NOT CRASHING</b>.
There are some other features added since the previous one, but I think the main point
has been conveyed. Download now!
