This is a basic infrastructure to build slackware packages from the E17
subversion repository. It's a kind of unstable SlackE17 for people who wants
bleeding-edge code and compile themself. Of course, there is absolutly no 
guarantee that everything will build flawlessly at any time.

To use this, you must:
- have a recent Slackware or Slackware64 distro (13.37 or current)
- got lua* and remix* packages installed (needed for dependencies)
- connman* package is not required but useful
- launch slacke17-svn-build.sh from this directory
- take a small nap during compilation

Packages will be under ${TMP}/slacke17-svn along with build logs

Note: Add optimization to gcc via the ECFLAGS environment variable.

* You can find these specific packages on the SlackE17 download page:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/slacke17/files/slacke17/efl-1.2.0/
