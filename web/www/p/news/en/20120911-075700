<p> It's that time again! A new week means a new snapshot of E17 
from your favorite release manager, so here we go.
This time, in addition to featuring the usual improvements of 
<b>LESS CRASHING<b> and <b>IMPROVEMENTS TO NOT CRASHING</b>, 
I'm pleased to announce some other changes, though this is not in any way
a comprehensive list, and not all the changes were made by me: 
</p>
<p>
<li>Significant <a href="https://e17releasemanager.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/enlightenment-heroes-of-the-week-bdilly-bruno-dilly-and-demarchi-lucas-de-marchi/">improvements</a> to the connman module</li>
<li>A slightly more intuitive interface to the filemanager configuration GUI </li>
<li>Fixes for taking screenshots with strange xinerama layouts</li>
<li>Two new maximization modes: left and right</li>
<li>An improved gadget setup dialog</li>
<li>Deleting a shelf now actually deletes it</li>
<li>Method for changing shelf position directly from the menu</li>
<li>Filemanager will no longer, in some rare cases, attempt to overwrite a file with a symlink to that file</li>
<li>Filemanager provides better support for moving files in cases where the file would be replaced</li>
<li>Filemanager can now sort files in a number of new ways</li>
</p>
