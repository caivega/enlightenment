This is, for the lack of a better name, EasyUI.

It is a work in progress to bring a MVC framework to build applications
using EFL and JavaScript.

Before trying to execute any file contained in this directory, make sure
``eui.edj'' is built:

	$ edje_cc eui.edc

Most example applications are simpler versions of what you would find on a
mobile device, like a Photo Browsing application, a Twitter client, a Note
taking application, among others.

The dictionary application requires a dictionary file, which will be
provided in the coming weeks (it is based on Webster's Unabridged Dictionary
as found on Project Gutemberg) and the old book theme compiled as well
(found in the ``themes'' directory).  Proper building tools will come with
time.

It is currently under heavy development, and although stable featurewise,
the API will most certainly change.  It is therefore not recommended to
write applications with this library unless you could live with the risk of
eventually having to rewrite part of your applications.  If living on the
bleeding edge is your thing, though, feedback is encouraged.  Better yet:
patches are welcome.

In any case, executing an EasyUI application is just the matter of elevating
it:

	$ elev8 photo.js

If your setup of Elev8 is working, you should see a list of your pictures
from ~/Photos.
