     <h3>What is it?</h3>
     <p>Terminology is a new terminal emulator. In fact as of the 12th
     of July 2012, it is only 1 month old, so all you see here is the
     result of some off-and-on work over approximately a month (so not
     full-time effort). This is an indicator of what is possible to do
     with EFL with some knowledge and effort in a fairly short space of
     time. This time included having to learn how terminal emulation
     works, pty's, escapes and so on and actually make a large selection
     of terminal applications work, so it's not perfect, but it's
     getting there.</p>
     
     <h3>What does it do?</h3>
     <p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/V0C3Y7AFwIk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
     <p>It emulates a slightly extended vt100 with some extensions and 
     bling thrown in.</p>
     <p><ul>
       <li>Most escapes supported by xterm, rxvt etc. work</li>
       <li>Xterm 256 color escapes work</li>
       <li>Backgrounds (bitmap, scalable/vector, animated gif, videos)</li>
       <li>Transparency</li>
       <li>Bitmap and scalable fonts</li>
       <li>Themes for the layout and design</li>
       <li>URL, file path and email address detection and link-handling</li>
       <li>Inline display of link content</li>
       <li>Multiple copy and paste selections and buffer support</li>
       <li>Works in X11</li>
       <li>Works in Wayland</li>
       <li>Works directly in the linux framebuffer (fbcon)</li>
       <li>Can be finger/touch controlled</li>
       <li>Scan scale by UI scaling factors</li>
       <li>Can render using OpenGL or OpenGL-ES2<li>
     </ul></p>
     <p>The above list of features and then then some work currently,
     with maybe some things not completely implemented yet. Much more
     has yet to come, so this is not done by any means.</p>

     <h3>Features</h3>
     <p>There are quite a range of nice features already supported,
     ranging from the basic ones you'd expect, to things you never expected
     of a terminal.</p>
     
     <p>There is a visual bell designed to get your attention. It's
     totally able to be customized by the theme to do almost anything your
     imagination desires.</p>

     <p>You can set a background (command-line only right now) that
     can be anything you like. Far beyond most terminal emulators as
     scalable vector graphics (PDF, PS and SVG) work, animated GIFs, Edje
     files and of course even videos</p>

     <p>ANSI colors as well as the 256 mode Xterm colors are supported
     for making sure your terminal text always looks bright and
     interesting.</p>

     <p>You can change fonts and sizes on the fly, with bitmap fonts
     supported (and shipped by default), as well as the usual scalable font
     support you'd expect.</p>

     <p>Links, full file paths and email addresses are "detected" in
     the terminal when your mouse overs over them, providing a nice
     underline allowing you to click and either have an external
     application handle the link, or have Terminology handle it internally
     for your viewing pleasure.</p>
     <p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xhfN_RkLNVI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

     <p>There are even other handy options to customize on the fly and
     be automatically saved for the next time you need them.</p>

     <h3>Why use Terminology?</h3>
     <p>If you like your terminals to look nice, then this is the
     terminal for you. If you want to have a terminal that is
     expanding usability by placing content right at your fingertips and
     directly in-line without needing an external window popping up, then
     this is for you. If you want the same terminal you know and love
     to work in the framebuffer when away from X11, then this is for
     you. The mouse even works, as does video and animation, framebuffer, X11
     or in Wayland. If you like a terminal that scrolls more than 10
     times faster than gnome-terminal, much faster than Xterm or Konsole
     and as fast as URXVT, then this is for you. If you like to save
     memory compared to the big-desktop terminals (gnome-terminal and
     Konsole) then this is for you.</p>
     
     <p>This project is not complete. It's barely a month old, but it
     has indications of where it will go. Try it out and see. Finally
     Enlightenment will have a terminal worth of calling its own.</p>
