cdef public class Layout(Object) [object PyElementaryLayout, type PyElementaryLayout_Type]:

    """This is a container widget that takes a standard Edje design file and
    wraps it very thinly in a widget.

    An Edje design (theme) file has a very wide range of possibilities to
    describe the behavior of elements added to the Layout. Check out the Edje
    documentation and the EDC reference to get more information about what can
    be done with Edje.

    Just like L{List}, L{Box}, and other container widgets, any
    object added to the Layout will become its child, meaning that it will be
    deleted if the Layout is deleted, move if the Layout is moved, and so on.

    The Layout widget can contain as many Contents, Boxes or Tables as
    described in its theme file. For instance, objects can be added to
    different Tables by specifying the respective Table part names. The same
    is valid for Content and Box.

    The objects added as child of the Layout will behave as described in the
    part description where they were added. There are 3 possible types of
    parts where a child can be added:

    Content (SWALLOW part)
    ======================

    Only one object can be added to the C{SWALLOW} part (but you still can
    have many C{SWALLOW} parts and one object on each of them). Use the
    C{Object.content_set/get/unset} functions to set, retrieve and unset
    objects as content of the C{SWALLOW}. After being set to this part, the
    object size, position, visibility, clipping and other description
    properties will be totally controlled by the description of the given part
    (inside the Edje theme file).

    One can use C{size_hint_*} functions on the child to have some
    kind of control over its behavior, but the resulting behavior will still
    depend heavily on the C{SWALLOW} part description.

    The Edje theme also can change the part description, based on signals or
    scripts running inside the theme. This change can also be animated. All of
    this will affect the child object set as content accordingly. The object
    size will be changed if the part size is changed, it will animate move if
    the part is moving, and so on.

    Box (BOX part)
    ==============

    An Edje C{BOX} part is very similar to the Elementary L{Box} widget. It
    allows one to add objects to the box and have them distributed along its
    area, accordingly to the specified C{layout} property (now by C{layout} we
    mean the chosen layouting design of the Box, not the Layout widget
    itself).

    A similar effect for having a box with its position, size and other things
    controlled by the Layout theme would be to create an Elementary L{Box}
    widget and add it as a Content in the C{SWALLOW} part.

    The main difference of using the Layout Box is that its behavior, the box
    properties like layouting format, padding, align, etc. will be all
    controlled by the theme. This means, for example, that a signal could be
    sent to the Layout theme (with L{Object.signal_emit()}) and the theme
    handled the signal by changing the box padding, or align, or both. Using
    the Elementary L{Box} widget is not necessarily harder or easier, it
    just depends on the circumstances and requirements.

    The Layout Box can be used through the C{box_*} set of
    functions.

    Table (TABLE part)
    ==================

    Just like the C{Box}, the Layout Table is very similar to the
    Elementary L{Table} widget. It allows one to add objects to the Table
    specifying the row and column where the object should be added, and any
    column or row span if necessary.

    Again, we could have this design by adding a L{Table} widget to the
    C{SWALLOW} part using L{Object.part_content_set()}. The same difference happens
    here when choosing to use the Layout Table (a C{TABLE} part) instead of
    the L{Table} plus C{SWALLOW} part. It's just a matter of convenience.

    The Layout Table can be used through the C{table_*} set of
    functions.

    Predefined Layouts
    ==================

    Another interesting thing about the Layout widget is that it offers some
    predefined themes that come with the default Elementary theme. These
    themes can be set by the call L{theme_set()}, and provide some
    basic functionality depending on the theme used.

    Most of them already send some signals, some already provide a toolbar or
    back and next buttons.

    These are available predefined theme layouts. All of them have class =
    C{layout}, group = C{application}, and style = one of the following options:

        - C{toolbar-content} - application with toolbar and main content area
        - C{toolbar-content-back} - application with toolbar and main content
            area with a back button and title area
        - C{toolbar-content-back-next} - application with toolbar and main
            content area with a back and next buttons and title area
        - C{content-back} - application with a main content area with a back
            button and title area
        - C{content-back-next} - application with a main content area with a
            back and next buttons and title area
        - C{toolbar-vbox} - application with toolbar and main content area as a
            vertical box
        - C{toolbar-table} - application with toolbar and main content area as a
            table

    Emitted signals
    ===============

    This widget emits the following signals:

        - "theme,changed": The theme was changed.
