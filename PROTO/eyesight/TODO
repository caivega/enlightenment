Modules

 * PDF backend: text:

<vtorri> is there a smple example to:
<vtorri> 1) find text with mupdf
<vtorri> 2) if I havea given rectangle, retrieving the text in the PDF document, with mupdf
<sebras> vtorri: there is a sample example in apps/mudraw.c of how to extract text.
<sebras> vtorri: if you run mudraw with -t you'll get the plain text printed and using -ttt you will get both the text and the corresponding boundingboxes printed.
<sebras> vtorri: then you have apps/pdfapp.c::pdfapp_search() that is the searching in the sample viewer.
<vtorri> ok
<vtorri> thank you
<sebras> and in pdfapp_inverthit() you'll find the implementation highlighting a search hit.
<vtorri> a search hit ?
<vtorri> what is it  ?
<sebras> search match.
<sebras> those functions ought to get you started at least, but feel free to ask further questions of course.
<vtorri> ok
<vtorri> thank you
<sebras> np.

 * XPS backend: MuPDF has an implementation
 * Comic book : MuPDF supports cbz. Use the libraries instead of the binaries ?
 * txt backend: improve a lot
 * dvi backend : to add
 * rtf backend: see ertf
 * djvu backend: to add
 * epub: to add
 * multipage TIFF: to add
 * editing pdf forms: check if MuPDF can do it.
 * search linking latex source with the corresponding location in DVI or PDF document (pdfsync)
 * chm (less important)
 * odt (less important)
 * actually, everything evince and okular support ? :-)

Architecture

 * make it fully asynchrone and work with smart object callback
 * share context between same opened file (think thumbnail)
 * be able to use ecore_thread_heavy_run to render one page in another thread (and scale way behond one thread)
 * use the threading support of MuPDF to speed up the rendering
