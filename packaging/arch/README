Written by Tom Hacohen, based on PKGBUILDs by Ronald van Haren <ronald.archlinux.org>. If you have any issues, fix them yourslef.
If you are interested in building e off svn, and not from your own sources, please use Ronald's script instead: https://dev.archlinux.org/~ronald/e17.html

1. Update PKGBUILD-ecommon with your project path.
2. Modify the list of packages to be built by modifying build_e.sh.
3. Make sure to run ./autogen with the wanted options and prefix before using this script.
4. Run "./build_e.sh version" e.g: "./build_e.sh 78987".
