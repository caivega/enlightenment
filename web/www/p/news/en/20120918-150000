<p> I'm sure there are people out there saying "There's no way
two E17 snapshots will ever come out on the same day."<br>
My response is as follows:<br>

This time, in addition to featuring the usual improvements of 
<b>LESS CRASHING</b> and <b>IMPROVEMENTS TO NOT CRASHING</b>, 
I'm pleased to announce some other changes, though this is not in any way
a comprehensive list, and not all the changes were made by me: 
</p>
<p>
<li>DND no longer causes random hangs in some situations</li>
<li>Crashes now occur much less often when running executables from E17 as seen since last night</li>
<li>Filemanager will no longer sometimes crash when changing directories as seen since yesterday</li>
<li>Filemanager tooltips now properly hide when leaving the source icon of the tooltip</li>
</p>

<p><ul>
