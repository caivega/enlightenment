 * @version @PACKAGE_VERSION@
 *
 * The Etam library is a library that implements an API for asynchronous
 * NOSQL database access on top of EET files. The main goal of this library
 * is to associate metadata to a key and quickly find them. The actual
 * ratio of read is expected to be higher than 99% read for 1% write.
 * The objectif of this library is to make it very easy for EFL developper
 * to associate meta data and retrieve them later.
 *
 * At the moment it already use a compressed boolean map to walk as fast
 * as possible over data that are not required. It is also designed to be
 * cache friendly by walking data that should be in cache and grouping
 * column when doing the search. With the current design their is a lot
 * of room for speed improvment when required.
 *
 * This library is cross-platform and can be compiled and used on
 * Linux, BSD, Opensolaris and Windows (XP and CE).
