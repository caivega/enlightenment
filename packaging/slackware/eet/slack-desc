# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

eet: Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of 
eet: data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a 
eet: zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on.
eet: It does not do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is 
eet: needed, and it was much simpler to implement this once here.
