<p>
It's time for (drum roll) the second alpha release of E17!<br>
There's a lot of fixes that went into this delayed release,
but I'm leaving work now so I won't mention them by name.
Nor will I mention glima, who single-handedly managed to break configs for everyone while blaming me for it.<br><br>
Enjoy this release, which I have helpfully nicknamed "Baldy" as a way of mocking one of my coworkers.
