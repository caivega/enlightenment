Terminology 0.2

<p>
Terminology is a terminal emulator that uses modern EFL components to
build its UI and core. It is written from scratch and does not use any
components outside of EFL and libc, so it should be very portable and
easy to build. For more information, please see the 
<a href=http://www.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=about/terminology>Terminology Page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.2 marks a stage of a lot of small cleanups, fixes and
improvements, but definitely not a finished and fully baked terminal
in all senses of the word. Not everything we want to achieve has been
achieved yet. Please get the release below.
