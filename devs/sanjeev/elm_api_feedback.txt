QuickLaunch
-----------
Not enough documentation about quicklaunch.
elm_quicklaunch_mode_set – use mode when multiple options are there. For Bool use quicklaunch_set/get

elm_need_* API"
---------------

EAPI Eina_Bool    elm_need_efreet(void);
EAPI Eina_Bool    elm_need_e_dbus(void);
Is it not a compile time option?"

elm_icon
--------
"elm_icon_memfile_set has optional format and edje key parameters.
Why should we provide format if it is optional? What is the point?

No documentation for elm_icon_thumb_set

elm_icon_no_scale_set rename to elm_icon_no_scale_unset, rather than _get.

Can these be named better?

Elm_Icon_Lookup_Order:
ELM_ICON_LOOKUP_FDO_THEME, 
ELM_ICON_LOOKUP_THEME_FDO, 
ELM_ICON_LOOKUP_FDO, 
ELM_ICON_LOOKUP_THEME 

What is the difference between elm_icon_animated_set and elm_icon_animated_play_set?


actionslider
------------

No reference link to Elm_Actionslider_Pos in documentation.

Can we replace indicator with slider ?

anchorview/anchorblock
----------------------
Can they be replaced with one widget, if a scroller is the only difference."

elm_anchorblock_item_provider_append/prepend/remove – why do we need these API?
What are the use cases / examples?

background
----------

No reference link to Elm_Bg_Option for elm_bg.

ElmImage
--------

ELM_IMAGE_ROTATE_90_CCW, /rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise (i.e. 270 degrees clockwise)
*/  - Why not 90, 180, 270? (CCW, CW ?)

ELM_IMAGE_FLIP_TRANSPOSE, ELM_IMAGE_FLIP_TRANSVERSE - With the X and Y axes being at the top or bottom / left or right ?

elm_image_object_size_get - On error, neither w or h will be written. What will it be? Please set to something predictable (like -1).

Confusing
---------

elm_image_no_scale_get - this one for elm_image object itself.
elm_image_scale_get - this one is for the image file.

it might be helpful to add an 'object' to elm_image_no_scale_get.

ElmImage needs more description about size, aspect ratio, fill , prescale.

Box
---
elm_box_clear  =  elm_box_unpack_all + evas_object_del
elm_box_unpack_all = elm_box_children_get + elm_box_unpack

Note : 
To use elm_box_unpack() developer needs to maintain a reference or clue to the object.

Seems like multiple API wrapped on top of one another.



Looks like we are using matching function prototypes, that don't mean the same thing.

elm_box_layout_transition and Evas_Object_Box_Layout.

elm_box_layout_transition - This function can only be used with elm_box_layout_set()
elm_box_layout_set(box, elm_box_layout_transition, t, elm_box_transition_free);
elm_box_layout_set(Evas_Object *obj, Evas_Object_Box_Layout cb, const void *data, void (*free_data)(void *data))


Creating an object that holds the function pointers and passing it as a *data to another function that takes a function pointer... 

Does not look elegant. Should be a better way of doing this.
How about individual API?

Button
------

IGNORE THIS COMMENT.
elm_button_icon_set/unset - deleting the previous icon object seems dangerous.
What if same icon object is used elsewhere as well?
Makes it easier for developer to commit mistakes.
elev8 reuses icon object and resets them in some examples.
If user created icon, it is his job to delete it.


FileSelector
------------
elm_fileselector_button_path_set - return type could be int giving errno value.

No API for showing/hiding hidden files.

File Selector API and File Manager module provide different levels of functionality.
Would be good to add some more functionality.

File_Selector_Entry seems wrong name, it must be File_Selector_Label.
Changing the entry doesn't really mean anything.

General
-------

Smart callbacks, smart API - needs more highlighting.
Is it smart for the API users or developers? Why is it called smart?

Scroller
--------
ELM_SCROLLER_POLICY_LAST - why is this required?

elm_scroller_custom_widget_base_theme_set - 'custom' applies to theme.


Label
-----

elm_label_ellipsis_set - shouldn't this be default behaviour ?

Will scrolling text get repeated ? 

Why not have one API and an enum, that will either scroll or ellipsise?

Gengrid
-------

elm_gengrid_horizontal_set - bad name - should be elm_gengrid_expand_mode_set()

elm_gengrid_item_tooltip_size_restrict_disable should be elm_gengrid_item_tooltip_size_restrict_disable_set

Clock
-----

Click and hold to increase clock values. Works fine for touchscreen, but for PC, isn't scroll more intuitive than click and hold ?

How do I make a millisec clock, a counter or a timer ? How to extend clock?

elm_clock_edit_get and elm_clock_digit_edit_get - why two sets of API?
One should be sufficient - elm_clock_digit_edit_get.

Layout
------

Eval sizing - not clean when this condition will occur.

Hover
-----

Can a hover be 'moved' across parents one parent to another?

Entry
-----

Is there any guarantee that entry text is always NULL terminated?

elm_entry_editable_* API is not really making the entry immutable.
User can still modify the entry using set_text() API.
If it is for "Label" - then there could be a elm_entry_label_set(true/false).
similar to password.

No elm_entry_entry_prepend?



FOR RELEASE 1.0
------------------------

elc_anchorblock.h

1. Considering elementary test is the reference app for all widgets, under each widget provide the command for seeing the widget in action.

like, elementary_test -to "<Name of Widget>"

2. Elm_Entry_Anchorblock_Info

Why Eina_Bool : 1 ?  Eina_Bool is an INT ? Why use only four lower order bits.  Why not a byte?

elm_pager.h

3. Why use the concept of stack to explain pager contents. It is not a stack if any element can be promoted or demoted. Stack is LIFO. This is an array or collection or group.

4. elm_pager_content_promote - why is it undefined behaviour to promote a non-existent object ? Doesn’t the pager know what’s on the stack ?

elm_panes.h

missing EAPI definitions and documentation in header - DONE.

elm_panes_fixed_set should be renamed to elm_panes_fixed_resize_set() - it applies only to resizing case. “Fixed” by itself is not so helpful.
