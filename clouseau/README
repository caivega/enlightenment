An UI inspection tool for the EFL. This tool lets you inspect UI elements and get a lot of their properties, e.g position, size and weight.

Clouseau consists of a client (clouseau_client) and launcher (clouseau_server). This design means we can:
1. Run the application we are debugging on one device and the clouseau_client itself on another.
2. Run the application we are debugging with a different environment/theme/etc compared to the clouseau client.

Clouseau provides a wrapper script that automatically launches the application with clouseau support, and launches the client, the script is called "clouseau".

Usage:
1. Using the wrapper script:
  "clouseau elementary_test" or "clouseau elementary_test Entry".
2. Using the split client/server approach (different machines/environments/setups):
  "clouseau_start elementary_test" and then "clouseau_client"
  As mentioned above, this is done over the network, so it can be run from different machines

Using the clouseau client:
When the client opens you'll be asked to enter the server's IP address. That's the IP address of where you ran clouseau_start from. When in doubt, just use the default, 127.0.0.1.
Then press "Ok" to connect to the server, and the rest should be fairly straightforward.
